My name is Lorenzo Mauro, I am from Rosario, Argentina.
My passion for technology dates back a long time. Almost 10 years ago I started studying electronic music production, more specifically **techno music**. From that point my vision of life is closely related to futurism and to follow the appearance of new technologies and new ways of communicating.

Since the middle of last year I have begun to internalize in the universe of programming. Discovering a **fascinating environment** that motivates me every day to continue learning and developing my knowledge...


Through the years I have managed to incorporate self-taught habits, which I believe are the most important for growth in a career of these characteristics. On the other hand, in a few months I will start the courses for the career of **"University Technician in Artificial Intelligence"** given at the National University of Rosario.


This, together with the challenges that I am proposing in the last time, lead me to be closer and closer to the things that I like and enjoy doing in life.
