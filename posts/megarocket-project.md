Megarocket is a project that I have carried out this year during the 4 months of the bootcamp provided by the company Radium Rocket.

Personally, the most important skills that I take away from this project are:

- **Teamwork:** During the process of this course, I have shared 3 different stages and **work teams**. With the help of great tutors who are part of the company, I was able to get the most out of the experience and learn for the first time what it feels like to work with **agile methodologies** and to be able to find my place within each team beyond the fact that it was my first experience of this kind.

- **Impulse:** This project has served me personally as a great kick to continue rekindling the flame that is within me towards **technology**. Understanding new concepts of web development both **front-end** and **back-end** that I think were essential to set the path for me to continue doing what I like..

*"Megarocket" is an innovative project that focuses on the development of a web system for the efficient handling of the administration and management of a gym. In order to facilitate the **dynamic registration** of your members, you can control the **schedule grid**, the available places and the assignment of trainers to each class. In addition, the system also handles **the management** of employee schedules.*
